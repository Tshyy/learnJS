# JavaScript Data structure and algorithm

>This branch is for leaning JavaScript data structure and algorithm.

实现了栈、队列、单向链表、双向链表





# Some interesting algorithm problems

## AddTwoBinary
- Add two binary string, output a binary string finally
- There are two method using to solve the problem: fucntion only and using dec to  binary with stack


    Given two binary strings, return their sum(also a binary string).
    for example,

    a="11"
    b="1"
    return "100"
